                    <p>
                        Ip Man, also known as Yip Man, (Chinese: 葉問; 1 October 1893 – 2 December 1972) was a Chinese
                        martial artist of Canton ancestry, and a master teacher of Wing Chun.<br>
                        He had several students who later became martial arts masters in their own right.<br>
                        His most famous student was Bruce Lee.

                    <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ip Man was born to Yip Oi-dor and Ng Shui, as the third of four children. He grew up in a
                        wealthy
                        family in Foshan, Guangdong, and received traditional Chinese education, alongside his elder
                        brother
                        Yip Kai-gak, his elder sister Yip Wan-mei, and younger sister Yip Wan-hum.<br>

                        Ip started learning Wing Chun from Chan Wah-shun in 1906 when he was 12. Chan was 57 at the
                        time,
                        and Ip became Chan's 16th and last student. Due to Chan's age, he was only able to train
                        Ip
                        for three years before suffering a mild stroke in 1909 and retiring back to his village. Ip
                        learned
                        most of his skills and techniques from Chan's second eldest disciple, Ng Chung-sok
                        (吳仲素).<br>

                        At the age of 16, with help from his relative Leung Fut-ting, Ip moved to Hong Kong and there he
                        attended school at St. Stephen's College, a secondary school for wealthy families and foreigners
                        living in Hong Kong. Six months after moving to Hong Kong, a classmate of Ip's named Lai told
                        him
                        that a friend of Lai's father who was an expert in Kung Fu techniques was living with them, and
                        had
                        offered to have a friendly sparring match with Ip. At the time, Ip was undefeated so he eagerly
                        accepted the challenge. He went to Lai's house on a Sunday afternoon, and after exchanging brief
                        pleasantries, challenged the man to a duel. The man was Leung Bik, and he easily overwhelmed Ip
                        Man.<br>
                        Incredulous at the speed with which he had been countered, Ip requested a second duel and was
                        beaten
                        again, just as soundly. Discouraged by his defeat, Ip left without a word and afterward was so
                        depressed that he did not dare mention that he knew Kung Fu. A week later, Lai told him that the
                        man
                        he had fought was asking after him. Ip replied that he was too embarrassed to return, at which
                        point
                        Lai told him that Leung Bik had highly praised his Kung Fu techniques and that he was the son of
                        Leung Jan, who trained Ip's master Chan Wah-shun. Ip proceeded to train with Leung Bik,[6] until
                        Leung's death in 1911.<br>

                        Ip returned to Foshan in 1917 when he was 24 and became a police officer there. He taught some
                        Wing Chun to several of his subordinates, friends and relatives, but did not officially run a
                        martial arts school.<br>

                        Ip later married Cheung Wing-sing and they had several children; sons Ip Chun and Ip Ching, and
                        daughters Ip Nga-sum (葉雅心) and Ip Nga-wun (葉雅媛).

                        Some of his best known informal students were Chow Kwong-yue (周光裕), Kwok Fu (郭富), Lun Kah (倫佳),
                        Chan
                        Chi-sun (陳志新), Xu He-Wei (徐和威) and Lui Ying (呂應). Among them, Chow Kwong-yue was said to be the
                        best, but he eventually went into commerce and stopped practising martial arts. Kwok Fu and Lun
                        Kah
                        went on to teach students of their own and they passed down the art of Wing Chun in the Foshan
                        and
                        Guangdong region. Chan Chi-sun and Lui Ying went to Hong Kong later but neither of them accepted
                        any
                        students.<br>

                        Ip went to live with Kwok Fu during the Second Sino-Japanese War and only returned to Foshan
                        after
                        the war, where he resumed his career as a police officer. Ip found some time to train his second
                        son
                        Ip Ching during the year 1949. At the end of 1949 after the Chinese Communist Party won the
                        Chinese
                        Civil War, as Ip was an officer for the Kuomintang, Ip, his wife and their elder daughter Ip
                        Nga-sum
                        left Foshan for Hong Kong.

                    <h2>Life in Hong Kong</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ip, his wife Cheung and their daughter arrived in Hong Kong through Macau in 1950. His wife and
                        daughter would later return to Foshan to retrieve their identity cards. However, due to the
                        closure
                        of borders between China and Hong Kong in 1951, Ip and Cheung were separated for good, with the
                        latter remaining in Foshan.<br>

                        Initially, Ip Man's teaching business was poor in Hong Kong because Ip's students typically
                        stayed
                        for only a couple of months. He moved his school twice: first to Castle Peak Road in Sham Shui
                        Po,
                        and then to Lee Tat Street (利達街) in Yau Ma Tei. By then, some of his students had attained
                        proficiency in Wing Chun and were able to start their own schools. They would go on and spar
                        with
                        other martial artists to compare their skills, and their victories helped to increase Ip's
                        fame.<br>

                        In about 1955, probably out of loneliness and realized the separation with his wife would be
                        permanent, he had a mistress from Shanghai, whom was referred by his students
                        simply as Shanghai Po (上海婆). Ip and this mistress also had an illegitimate son named Ip Siu-wah
                        (葉少華). Meanwhile at Foshan, his wife Cheung died of cancer in 1960. Ip never formally introduced
                        his
                        mistress to his other sons, who eventually arrived in Hong Kong to reunite with him in 1962.<br>


                        Ip Man and Bruce Lee.
                        In 1967, Ip and some of his students established the Ving Tsun Athletic Association (詠春體育會).
                        The main purpose of the Ving Tsun Athletic Association was to help Ip tackle his financial
                        difficulties in Hong Kong, which was said to have caused his supposed regular use of opium.
                        One of his former students, Duncan Leung, claimed that Ip used tuition money to support his
                        opium
                        addiction. Ip's mistress died of cancer in 1968, and their son would later become a Wing Chun
                        practitioner, like his half-brothers.

                    <h2>Death & legacy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ip died on 2 December 1972 in his unit at 149 Tung Choi Street in Hong Kong, from throat cancer,
                        only seven months before the death of Bruce Lee. He was buried at Wo Hop Shek, Hong Kong.<br>

                        Ip's legacy is the global practice of Wing Chun. Ip Chun, the eldest son of Ip Man, is
                        passionate
                        and relentless in keeping his father's Wing Chun kung fu legacy alive. In 2014, Ip Chun was
                        selected
                        to represent Wing Chun as the inheritor of the legacy of Wing Chun-style kung fu. Ip's notable
                        students include: Leung Sheung, Lok Yiu, Chu Shong-tin, Wong Shun Leung, Bruce Lee, Moy Yat, Ho
                        Kam
                        Ming, Victor Kan, his nephew Lo Man Kam, his sons Ip Ching and Ip Chun, and closed door disciple
                        Leung Ting (as stated in an interview with Grand Master Ip Man by New Martial Hero Magazine,
                        1972)<br>

                        Ip wrote a history of Wing Chun. Many artifacts of his life are on display in the "Yip Man
                        Tong"
                        museum in the Foshan Ancestral Temple grounds. Ip Man is also included in many films based on
                        his
                        life.
