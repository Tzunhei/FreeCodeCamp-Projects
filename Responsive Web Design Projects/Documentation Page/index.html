                </header>
                <p>Allow other parts of your program to carry on and run while other potentially blocking script wait to
                    complete. </p>
                <h3>Synchronous</h3>
                <p>Only one thing is able to run to completion at any given time.
                    Drawback => It makes the page unresponsive. The user is not able to interact with the page until the
                    requested data is eventually returned.
                    JS is a synchronous, single-threaded language.</p>
                <h3>How does Asynchronous programming works?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Call Stack</h3>
                        <p>JavaScript runtime (or host) environments like the browser and Node have a built-in
                            interpreter
                            that executes JavaScript code. It's called the JavaScript engine. The engine has a
                            mechanism,
                            called the call stack, for keeping track of the order of function calls and where it is in a
                            program at any given moment.

                            Anytime a function gets called, it gets pushed onto the call stack, and any functions called
                            within the original function are pushed higher up onto the call stack. When a function is
                            done
                            executing, it gets popped off the top of the call stack, and the next function in the stack
                            gets
                            processed.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Web APIs</h3>
                        <p>The call stack handles asynchronous tasks in a different way than synchronous tasks. Whenever
                            the
                            JavaScript environment encounters code that needs to run and execute at a later time, like a
                            setTimeout() callback or a network request, that code is handed off to a special Web API
                            that
                            processes the async operation. Meanwhile, the call stack moves on to other tasks then
                            revisits
                            the async task when it's ready to be dealt with.
                            It's important to note that the asynchronous behavior of JavaScript does not come from the
                            JavaScript engine itself. JavaScript engines like Chrome's V8, for instance, do not have
                            asynchronous capabilities. Asynchronicity actually comes from the runtime environment.
                            Runtime
                            environments (like web browsers and Node) provide APIs that let JavaScript run tasks
                            asynchronously.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Callback Queue</h3>
                        <p>You learned that web APIs are what actually process async operations while keeping the call
                            stack
                            clear of blocking operations. When a web API is done processing an async task, it's not
                            immediately executed on the call stack. Instead, its associated callback function gets
                            pushed
                            into something called the callback queue, which is a list (or line) containing all the async
                            task callbacks waiting to be executed.
                            You can think of the callback queue as a holding area for all the callbacks that are waiting
                            to
                            be put on the call stack and eventually executed. Only callbacks for (non-blocking)
                            operations
                            that are scheduled to complete execution at a later time like setTimeout, setInterval and
                            AJAX
                            requests, for example, are added to the callback queue.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>The event Loop</h3>
                        <p>The event loop has one important job: monitor the call stack and callback queue. Anytime the
                            call
                            stack is empty, the event loop takes the first task from the callback queue and pushes it
                            onto
                            the call stack, and runs it. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </header>
                <p>Callbacks to manage asynchronous requests along with the XML http request API can be a bit too
                    complex to
                    use and manage compare to the modern data fetching API tools and syntax JS introduced in ES2015 and
                    ES
                    2017.
                    A callback function in an asynchronous program executes at some point later, once the parent
                    function
                    receives the data it needs.
                </p>
                <h3>Pyramid of doom</h3>
                <p>Multiple callbacks are nested one after the other, making your code difficult to understand and
                    maintain.

                </header>
                <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. The function that
                    receives
                    the callback function is often referred to as the "parent" function. The callback function is then
                    called and executed later, after the parent function has finished executing.
                    For example, the add function below accepts a function as its third argument (via the parameter
                    callback). When add is invoked, the function passed to it logs the sum of the values passed in for
                    aand
                    b.</p>
                <code>
                                function add(a, b, callback) {
                                    callback(a + b);
                                  }
                                  
                                  add(2, 4, function(sum) {
                                    console.log(sum); // 6
                                  });
                        </code>
                <p>In the following example, the function getUserName accepts a function as an argument (via the
                    parameter
                    callback). The greeting function passed to getUserName is invoked after prompt()captures a name and
                    stores it in the variable name.</p>
                <code>
                                function getUserName(callback) {
                                    const name = prompt('What is your name?');
                                    callback(name);
                                  }
                                  
                                  function greeting(name) {
                                    alert('Hello, ' + name);
                                  }
                                  
                                  getUserName(greeting); // a reference to the greeting function is passed to the function

                <h3>Promises states:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pending: default state, waiting</li>
                    <li>Fulfilled: operation completed successfully</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Working with Promises:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a promise instance using the Promise() constructor</li>
                    <li>Define what should happen when the promise is fulfilled or rejected</li>
                    <li>Consume the value of a fulfilled promise, or provide a rejection reason for a rejected promise

                <code>

                <p>Function return a promise object that is either pending, fulfilled or rejected.</p>
                <p>resolve() => resolves the status of the promises from pending to fulfilled. Argument which then
                    becomes
                    the fulfilment value of the promise.</p>
                <p>reject(arg) => if not specified, promise will failed silently. Program will continue to execute as if
                    everything was fine.</p>
                <h3>Promises methods:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>then() :<br> can handle both fulfilled and rejected promises. 2 arguments, 1 for fulfilled and one
                        optional for rejected promises.</li>
                    <li>catch() :<br> handle rejected promises</li>
                    <li>Promise.all():<br>
                        Useful when waiting for more than one promise to resolve.
                        Accepts an utterable such as a string or an array. (usually array of promises)
                        Going to wait on all of the individual promise objects then joins them into one and returns a
                        value
                        when all the specified promises are fulfilled. If one fails then rejects the entire promise.
                        Is an all or nothing operation.
                        Promise.all joins multiple individual promises into a single returned Promise when all of the
                        promises resolves.</li>
                    <li>Perform cleanup with finally():<br>
                        Gets called once a promise is fully settled. Usually best to use finally as the last chain
                        method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using fetch():<br>
                        Fetch takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. Can get rid of
                        the
                        getJSON function entirely because this fetch method is going to handle most of these tasks for
                        us.
                        Return a promise, once fetch makes the requests and the data finishes loading, the fetch promise
                        is
                        fulfilled.
                        fetch() returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object.
                        In order to access and use the data, we need to parse it to JSON first.
                        then(response => response.json());

                <p>Lets you write Asynchronous promise-based code that looks more like synchronous code.

                <h3>Await Keyword</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pauses the execution of an async function and waits for the resolution of a promise</li>
                    <li>Resumes execution and returns the resoled value</li>
                    <li>Pausing execution is not going to cause blocking behavior</li>
                    <li>Valid only inside functions marked async</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Async function always returns a promise.
                    That promise resolves with the value returned by the async function, or rejects with an error thrown
                    from within the function.

                    Can combine async/await with traditional promises but not meant to replace it.
                    Syntactic sugar for creating functions that return and wait for promises.
                    It’s a supplement to promises.

                    Error handling with try..catch:
                    Most common way to handle exceptions when using async/await.
                    await wait for response => fulfilled or rejected => if rejected then throw error => catch</p>
